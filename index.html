         <h5>SYRACUSE, NY</h5> 

         <p> The Central New York region is home to a variety of vast, scenic state parks. Some, like Green Lakes State Park and Delta Lakes State Park, have amenities that attract hundreds of thousands of guests per year, with steady attendance records going all the way back to 2003. However, in these seemingly steady records of attendance, one year sticks out from the rest.</p> 
        <p>The year 2020 left Americans with a lot less action in their lives. The various closures and shutdowns yielded less options for recreation and entertainment. However, for Syracuse Native, Eagle Scout, and avid outdoorsman Michael DiBlasi, there was one way of keeping busy that COVID seemingly could not stop: going to the park. </p>

        <p>Despite restrictions put on by the State of New York that caused a lack of employees and technical open hours at state parks, DiBlasi and many others still cashed in on one of the few hobbies that could be enjoyed while staying six feet apart. </p>

        <p>“Some parks within the area were closed. This mostly meant vehicles were blocked from entering and the usual staff had absconded,” DiBlasi said, “This made visiting the parks particularly in a group or as an organization more difficult. In spite of this, I still went on a few hikes.” </p>

        <p>Similarly to DiBlasi, millions of Central New Yorkers still went to state parks during this pandemic.</p>

      <p>With this notion, it is a common conception that since people had nothing to do, the basically unchanging environment in parks would thrive. The ability to participate in recreation without having to deal with human contact is what would be thought to attract more people than usual in this unseen circumstance.</p> 

      <p>The problem is, as seen in the chart above, this did not happen all across the board. Yes, there were significant increases in attendance during the COVID pandemic at some parks, but at others the attendance stayed on the same track or even significantly decreased. This begs the question: why would a nation-wide pandemic cause people to increasingly go to only certain parks and not just all of the parks as a whole? </p>

      <p>According to a statement from New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historical Preservation, some of the attendance decreases could be a result of cancellations within the park. Indeed, the coming of the pandemic meant that concerts, outings, and shelter reservations were all halted, making many of the parks that catered to big group activities take hits to their attendance. </p>

      <p>DiBlasi also thinks the style of park was a major factor, but he puts it in a different light.</p>

      <p>“Green Lakes is a more recreational park that has a great hiking trail and is more accessible for families and couples. It is a place with a core demographic of casual hikers and individuals who are already in proximity. The Parks that saw a decrease would be more extreme.” DiBlasi said.</p>

      <p>Without a doubt, the geographical conditions in some parks in the CNY region can be a real challenge for rookies to the outdoors, especially when mixed with the harsh weather that the area can get. </p>

      <p>“I once got the sub-zero badge for sleeping in a hand made igloo at Fort Drum during Early February. It was -5 degrees outside and -20 wind chill,” DiBlasi said, “You would not attempt to do that by yourself nor could you convince your mother to come with you.”</p>

        <p>It is reasonable to believe that geographical conditions and the perceived “extreme” level of some of the parks mentioned can be applied to parks all around America during this time. If a park has more of a difficult area/not as many widely popular amenities (water, easy trails), then it would be safe to assume that more of these new outdoorsmen and women would look to go to those easier more pleasing parks</p>

    <p>This case becomes even stronger when age is considered. Yes, there are many able-bodied people around the world, but it is in a very specific age window that people are most capable of climbing tough mountains and walking through tough trails. Therefore, there would be more reason to support that the attendance of the easily traversed, age-inclusive parks in the country would be of more benefit during the pandemic.</p> 

    <p>Michael DiBlasi thinks it should be taken state by state:</p>

    <p>“I believe that this trend could be seen in states similar to New York and their government’s reaction to covid. Maybe California with their vast state parks and increased covid restrictions could mirror New York's trend if not surpass it. However, states like Kansas or Alaska have seriously different results,” DiBlasi said, “Alaska has wildlife tourism, so they were hit especially hard for those major federal parks.” </p>

    <p>In general, the COVID pandemic brought on many crises to Americans, especially one of mental health. The people lost their hobbies and had to find new ones to take up. With the ability to go to parks, many Central New Yorkers took to the most popular ones to try being an outdoorsman or woman. </p>

    <p>These parked boomed during this time, while the more hardcore state parks stayed in the same ballpark or even dropped in attendance, and although there is no doubt that people still sought great mental help from being outside in all of these facilities, the data shows that many people did not stick with the park system and just had an outdoors phase when left with limited entertainment.</p>
